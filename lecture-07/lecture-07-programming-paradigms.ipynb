    "Programming paradigms allow us to categorize programming languages into hirearchical families. The hirearchical aspect of this categorization is important since the categorization is relative. It is very similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)#Kingdoms_and_domains\">taxonomy of biology</a>, in which al living beings are classified into categories: when compared to another kingdom, the members of a single kingdom seem relatively similar. However, if the members are compared among themselves, relative differences become important, and can be used to further classify the members into Phylumns, Classes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of any such classification is to simplify comparisions of members. There are several hundreads programming languages around. It is unrealistic to expect developers to learn about all (or even a majority) of them. However, it is still pretty useful for developers to understand the general tradeoffs between these programming languages, so that they can make informed decisions in what languages to use, or what resources to look for.\n",

    "Programming Paradigms provide the developers with exactly that. Members of a programming paradigms have certain similarties, that allow them to be abstracted together into a paradigm. The paradigm exhibits the same general tradeoffs when compared to other paradigms. The more detailed we make our paradigm, the few languages it contains, and the more accurate its description of tradeoffs is. However, making paradigms too detailed will entail having many paradigms, making it unrealistic for developers to understand all of them. Hence, paradigms are structured hierarchicaly, where the top level paradigms are abstract and few, and the lower level ones are more detailed and plenty.\n",

The main advantage of this is increased flexibility and friendliness. Developers using a programming language can choose to use features more applicable to their particular task, or to mix different features for increased productivity and simplicity.\n",

It is a very powerful technique. It has a static analysis component very similar to what we saw in the previous lecture.\n",

Some languages allows you to write the instrumentation code as part of the client code, and run it during the program run time, this can be acheived in Python and JavaScript (via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)). Other languages may allow you to write instrumentation code in separate modules, that are run automatically during a compilation stage prior to running the application, this can be done in modern Java using [annotation processing](https://medium.com/@jintin/annotation-processing-in-java-3621cb05343a) (e.g. [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)). Other languages do not support instrumentation directly. Instead, they provide external tools that can be used to perform instrumentation when desired prior to or after compilation, examples of this include using [Apache BCEL](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bcel/) for manipulating Java Byte code after compilation, or [LLVM-level instrumentation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7806689/instrumenting-c-c-code-using-llvm) of machine code.\n",

    "This solution is also close to idea, but has different characteristics than the reflection solution. The instrumentation implementation may have inaccuracies: for example, it may think that certain statements should be timed even when they should not be. Our particular implementation performs dumb analysis to determine when to instrument a statement, and can be improved to get a better accuracy, at the cost of making the implementation complex (and more bug prone). There are theoretical limits, as interesting code analysis in general is undeciadable to perform with perfect accuracy.\n",

For example, the name of the instance of the library object being used. Notice the print statements above show that name. In general, instrumentation has access to a wealth of context information it can use to run sophisticated static analysis, and do interesting things.\n",
